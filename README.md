## Overview of Rust-Backend-smtp Backend ðŸ”Ž

The backend of Rust-Backend-smtp is responsible for handling server-side logic, managing APIs, and integrating with external services. It provides functionalities such as email handling, CORS setup, and route configuration to ensure a secure and reliable experience for users interacting with the backend.

### Main Objectives:

-   Implement server-side logic to handle incoming requests and serve appropriate responses.
-   Ensure security measures are in place to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
-   Integrate with external services for email communication and data handling.

### Key Features:

-   Actix Web Framework: Utilizes Actix Web, a powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust, for building robust APIs and handling HTTP requests.
-   Middleware: Employs various middleware functions for handling CORS, CSRF protection, error handling, and rate limiting.
-   Lettre: Integrates Lettre for sending emails, providing a reliable solution for email communication.
-   Configuration: Modularizes project configuration to keep settings organized and manageable.

### General Architecture:

-   Backend Server: The backend server built with Actix Web, responsible for handling API requests and serving responses.
-   Middleware Layer: Middleware functions used for processing incoming requests, applying security measures, and handling errors.
-   Controllers: Modules containing logic for handling specific routes and business logic, such as sending emails.

## Getting Started with Rust-Backend-smtp Backend ðŸš€

To get started with Rust-Backend-smtp Backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Rust-Backend-smtp`
3. **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    - Define the following environment variables in the `.env` file:
        - `FRONTEND_URL`: The URL of the frontend application that will interact with the backend.
        - `EMAIL_USER`: The email address used for sending emails.
        - `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: The password associated with the email address for authentication.
        - `BACKEND_ADDRESS`: The address at which the backend server will be accessible. If not specified, defaults to `127.0.0.1:8080`.
        - `BACKEND_ADDRESS_LOCAL`: The local address at which the backend server will be accessible. If not specified, defaults to `localhost:8080`.
4. **Install dependencies:**
    ```shell
    cargo build
    ```
5. **Run the server:**
    ```shell
    cargo run
    ```
6. **Access the backend APIs** at the specified server address.

### Running with Optimization:

For production deployment or optimized performance, you can build and run the server with optimized settings:

1. **Build the project with optimization:**

    ```shell
    cargo build --release
    ```

    This command compiles the project with optimizations enabled.

2. **Run the server with optimized settings:**

    ```shell
    cargo run --release
    ```

    This command executes the server with optimizations enabled for improved performance.

3. **Access the backend APIs** at the specified server address.
